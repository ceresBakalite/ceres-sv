<h3>Data Repositories <img class="img-pointer" src="https://ceresbakalite.github.io/ceres-sv/images/CSVPeriscope.png"></h3>
<p>Weâ€™ve crafted extensive data repositories including common abbreviations, acronyms, business language and even jargon, that reside in the cloud. These libraries can be enhanced, either on a user, client or global basis to target specific types of data and can be used to facilitate accurate blending of otherwise disparate data sets. Your original data content is always preserved.</p>

<h3>Creating Matching Patterns <img class="img-pointer" src="/ceres-sv/images/CSVBulb.png"></h3>
<p>You can select and save from multiple preference types when defining search patterns.</p>
<p>Phonetic matching alleviates sound pronunciation where spelling can be overlooked.  Words can be created, removed and normalized automatically, all without altering your original data content. The cutoff point is simply wherever the matching comparisons found are determined to be so numerous as to be of no interest.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors <img class="img-pointer" src="/ceres-sv/images/CSVCogs.png"></h3>
<p>Realistically there are many authors spanning many years of enterprise, from John W. Ratcliff and John A. Obershelp through to the much more recent <a href="https://gist.github.com/jbtule/4336842">@jbtule</a>.  I have jumped all over many a reference upon whose shoulders I have had the luxury of standing.  At some point I will endeavour to more effectively highlight their work in my GitHub pages.</p>
<p>Most definitely though, a shout out goes to Andrew Karno <i>maxime summus magistratus</i>, who would never credit himself, and who not only sewed the seed, but pruned the branches as well.</p>

<h3>Proof of Concept <img class="img-pointer" src="/ceres-sv/images/CSVCreate.png"></h3>
<p>As a proof of concept exercise a principle focus has been to utilize Amazon Web Services (AWS RDS) as the SQL Server database repository, AWS EC2 S3 as the default update repository facilitating the automation of the latest release, and GitHub repositories holding all releases as the primary application place holder.</p>

<h3>Support or Contact <img class="img-pointer" src="/ceres-sv/images/CSVRing.png"></h3>
<p>Similarity is free to use and is only a GitHub baby.</p>
<p>As such, online support and documentation are still gestating.  Please contact me <a href="https://github.com/ceresbakalite">@ceresbakalite</a> directly at GitHub.  Leave a comment, ask a question and I will respond.</p>
<p>On that note. Updates are automatic, but if you do wish to download the product for the first time you can do so, but please get in touch as Similarity is still very much a beta release.</p>
